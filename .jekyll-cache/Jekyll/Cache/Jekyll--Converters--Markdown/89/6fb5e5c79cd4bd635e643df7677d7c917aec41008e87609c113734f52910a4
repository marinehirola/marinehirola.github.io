          <h4 class="xs-space">Focus Areas</h4>
          <div>At the outset of this project, it was necessary to both research the high-end furniture market and to conduct competition analysis for designer furniture e-commerce. Until 2020, the majority of Redsoul's clients had been commercial businesses and interior designers, but they wanted to transition into retailing directly to consumers.
          <br /><br />
          Before designing the site I wanted to understand on the market side:
          <br />
          1. Who buys highend furniture?<br />
          2. How do people find new furniture makers that match their style?
          <br /><br />
          And from a UX standpoint:
          <br />
          1. What are the current standards for features and product information amongst our potential competitors?
          <br />2. What are the needs of our different user groups?
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="md-space">
          <h4 class="xs-space">Market Research</h4>
          <div class="xs-space">I looked at the traffic data for the most trafficked high-end furniture sites and separately at the most similar designer focused sites, looking insights about our potential audience. This included data about the demographics, social traffic, devices, keywords, and similar sites. </div>
          <div class="col-md-12 half-content">

        <div class="md-space">
          <h4 class="xs-space">Competition Analysis</h4>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="nolpad xs-space col-md-6">I took the most similar designer-focused furniture sites and tracked type and detail level of information provided for each product and designer to help us determine what information we needed to compile for our site. Later I did a competition analysis for features of the e-commerce sites and businesses strategies to help us position our site. It gave a good sense of what was essential, what we could scrap, and what we hoped to build in the future.

        </div>
        <div class="xs-space">
          <h4 class="xs-space">Designer Partners</h4>
          <div>After years of working directly with many kinds of clients, Redsoul was especially skilled in guiding those without experience in furniture or product design through the production process. Part of the business strategy was to recruit new and influential creatives and work with them to develop "signature" pieces for which they would receive commissions. This meant the designers were a second customer/user for the website with their own motivations and needs. Talks with the independent designers revealed that it was important that they maintain their own identity outside of the Signature Pick brand.

          <h4 class="xs-space">Site Map</h4>
          <div>Using the information collected from the competition analysis and a list of all the products we were going to offer, I mapped out what categories and pages we would include in the first iteration of the site and created a basic site hierarchy.
          <br /><br />
          Notable for us, was the heavy emphasis on the Designers section. Each designer would have a profile page that would act as mini store front and feature relevant content about their work.

          We decided that the website launch would need to be broken down into phases, with more advanced features such as "saves" and designer log-ins being part of Phase 2, along with expanding our categories to include projects that were under development, such as lighting.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="nolpad col-sm-6 xs-space">For this project I identified three important user groups for our website, the obvious one being customers, the second being our designers, and the third being potential designers. For the customers, we wanted to create a simpler process for buying our unique, handcrafted furniture. For example, we redesigned our shipping process so it was possible for the customer to pay for shipping at check out without the need for shipping estimates and additional billings.

        <div class="md-space">
          <h4 class="xs-space">Wireframes</h4>
          <div class="col-sm-12 sm-space">I started by building wireframes for the general layout and flow of site.  I wanted to a minimal, clean aesthetic that would work with the different styles of the furniture, and drew inspiration from Rolex and CB2 sites. For the Designers page, I imagined a cross between a designer bio and a store front, with the option for designers to create featured collections.<br />
          The owner of the company felt strongly about having a very minimalist landing page so I proposed a homepage with links to "all products" and "designers" with an infinite scroll option below to simply browse through beauty images of products, like in an instagram feed.

        <div class="xs-space">
            <h4 class="xs-space">Prototyping</h4>

              <div>After creating some wireframes, I quickly moved to higher fidelity XD mockups which I found more helpful in illustrating the kind of information and resources we would need to start building the site. Using the prototype function, I built an interactive version for the site owner, that demonstrated certain important pages and interactions including the product pages, designer pages, and menus.<br /><br /> The homepage had scroll down arrow to hint to users that there was more beyond the minimal interface, leading to an 'infinite scroll' of products, inspired by instagram. On the product pages the most important element was the photos. Research had shown that more photos available meant that it was less likely customers would be dissatisfied and return products. A 'tabbed' section would let users switch from product details to shipping info and link to the tearsheet.

          <div class="md-space">I had created a temporary wordmark at the beginning of the project, but as we progressed with the site development, a logo redesign and expansion of brand guidelines became necessary. I sketched a number of logos, chose some to refine in Illustrator and presented a variety of options to the owners. They selected some favorites that I further refined and paired with style mood boards, which helped us to settle on a final logo and aesthetic direction.

        <div class="xs-space">
          <h4 class="xs-space">UI Design</h4>
          <div class="xs-space">I wanted the visual design of the website and branding to be modern and minimal, to be able to complement any of the designer's styles and also reflect the prevalent aesthetic. I had presented the logos along with the long form "Signature Pick" and the winner was Montserrat. I liked Montserrat because it was very flexible; depending on how you styled it it could be modern or traditional, is open source, and available with a variety of weights and special symbols. From here I tried a variety of body fonts, for awhile I had used Open Sans, but wanted something with a bit more personality and eventually settled on Brandon Grotesque, which was modern, warm, and legible.

            <h4 class="xs-space">Shopify</h4>
            <div>Since the team working on the site was so small, I wanted to build the working website using an existing e-commerce software. After evaluating the options, I chose to move forward with Shopify for it's ease of scaling and available apps that would be helpful with LTL freight shipping. For most of the site I modified an existing template to fit our layout and branding, but for specific pages I developed custom templates and content sections. Mostly this was done with HTML and CSS, but Shopify uses Liquid templating language which I learned in order to make dynamic content for the site.

            <div class="xs-space">When conducting research, social media was identified as an important aspect of marketing furniture and home products. Given the limited resources for this project, I developed a social media strategy that would take advantage of the images we already had and content that would help develop the site at the same time. I built our strategy around "content pillars" and leaned heavily into our brand "why"which for us was about Designers, Craftsmanship, and Process. I arranged and conducted interviews with the designers in order to create profiles and quotable content, planned and photographed process and detail shots of our products, and created and maintained a visual style for our social media content.
