<div class="sm-space">
These ornaments are unglazed porcelain,Â and have a lovely soft surface. This started as a pandemic project in 2020, but the caps that I found available for purchase were unsatisfying and it took me another year to find a solution I was happy with, fabricating my own with laser cut brass I bend to fit each piece.</div>
        <div class="sm-space">About me<br />

A little bit about me, I studied industrial design, but I've always loved learning about traditional crafts and how to make my own functional pieces.  I've worked at jewelry, metalworking and ceramics studios, and I currently live on Beacon Hill.</div>
