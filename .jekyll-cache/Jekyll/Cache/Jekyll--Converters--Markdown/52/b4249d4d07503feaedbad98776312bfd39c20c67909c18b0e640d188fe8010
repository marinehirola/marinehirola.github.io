            Greetings,
        </div> 
        <div class="md-space">
            Welcome KSMMers, my name is Mariko and I'm a designer/maker in Seattle, thanks for dropping by! Here's a little more information about my ornaments and myself:
        </div>
        <h2 class="sm-space"> About the ornaments</h2>
        <div class="md-space"> These ornaments are unglazed porcelain, sanded to a lovely soft surface. The colors are created by adding mason stains to the white clay body. More information about the slipcasting process can be found <a href="/work/sansake.html">here</a>. All the ornament caps that I found available for purchase were unsatisfying, so I decided to make my own with by ordering laser cut brass that I bend to fit each piece. </div>
        <h2 class="sm-space">About me</h2>
        <div class="md-space">I'm a designer who loves to make. I studied industrial design because I adore making functional pieces that I get to use everyday. In my quest to learn how to make everything, I've worked as a jeweler, web designer, photographer, metal finisher, handyman, ceramicist, and more. </div>
         <div class="md-space">If you're interested in updates about my work, follow me on instagram @marikohirasawa, or if you want to chat about clay or design or anything send me an email.</div>
