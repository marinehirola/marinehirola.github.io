                    <p>As a designer with a background in industrial design, web design, and contemporary craft, I have a unique interdisciplinary understanding of user experience with physical and digital products. I am passionate about creating beautiful, intuitive, and interesting experiences in almost any medium.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Most recently I've been a visual designer for a non-profit focused on reducing the spread of Covid-19. Previously, I worked as sole UX designer for a luxury handcrafted furniture studio. Before that, I helped the US team of ASKXXI put on an art + science exhibition in Chile. I'm strong believer in cross-disciplinary collaboration and human-centered design and their power to create meaningful and empathetic solutions for the world's biggest problems.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>I find inspiration in nature, science, food, and travel. In my off time I like to learn a new skill (currently teaching myself some JavaScript and basketweaving), and go on urban hikes.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>I graduated from CCA in 2012, earning a B.F.A. in Industrial Design with minor in Visual Studies. I'm currently based in my beautiful hometown, Seattle, Washington and looking for freelance opportunities and creative collaborations, so reach out and let's connect!</p>
