        <h2 class="sm-space"> About the ornaments</h2>
        <div class="md-space"> These ornaments are unglazed porcelain,Â and have a lovely soft surface. This started as a pandemic project in 2020, but the caps that I found available for purchase were unsatisfying and it took me another year to find a solution I was happy with, fabricating my own with laser cut brass I bend to fit each piece.</div>
        <h2 class="sm-space">About me</h2>
        <div class="md-space">A little bit about me, I studied industrial design, but I've always loved learning about traditional crafts and how to make my own functional pieces.  I've worked at jewelry, metalworking and ceramics studios, and I currently live on Beacon Hill.</div>
         <div class="md-space">I don't currently sell my work anywhere, but I'm hoping to in the near future. If you're interested in updates, follow me on instagram @marikohirasawa, or if you want to chat about clay or design or bouldering or anything send me an email.</div>
