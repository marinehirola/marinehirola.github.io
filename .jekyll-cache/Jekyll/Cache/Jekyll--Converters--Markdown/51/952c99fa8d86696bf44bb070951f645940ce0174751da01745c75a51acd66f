        <div class="sake-txt">For version two I modeled and 3D printed the positive. I found I was able to achieve the handmade aesthetic I wanted just by the nature of casting and finishing by hand. After priming and sanding I made several molds from the print.</div>

        <div class="sake-txt">Slip casting absorbs moisture from liquid clay poured into a plaster mold. A layer of clay builds and when the desired thickness is reached the excess clay is poured out and the piece is left to dry until it is ready to trim and remove.</div>
