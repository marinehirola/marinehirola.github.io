        <div class="sm-space"></div>
        <p>Restart Partners is a non-profit organization providing policy and technical assistance to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on citizens, communities, and economies in Washington State and beyond. They employ evidence-based tools to protect the most vulnerable, increase public trust, and encourage safe economic recovery.

I was brought in to assist in a redesign of the Restart website as many of their projects became public. The main tasks were to showcase these projects, and make the site easier to navigate. I was also tasked with expanding upon existing branding elements and creating new assets.

        <div class="sm-space"></div>
        <p>While discussing the site with the team, we identified several challenges that would exist with the redesign. The previous site had been updated on the fly, meaning often times the information was hard to find and the site difficult to navigate. Additionally the organization was unable to estimate the scope of how many projects the website would eventually feature, so we needed to design a flexible layout that could be easily updated and expanded with content from a variety of partners. We decided we needed to update the site architecture to allow for better scaling as well as leading the organization through a content audit to determine what information we would bring forward.</p>

        <div class="sm-space"></div>
        <p>We were inspired by clean, colorful websites, and the visual vocabulary of social media. I refined the existing logo, created new logo variations for different applications, and expanded the branding to include typography recommendations, recommended colors, and branding use cases.

After creating some quick wireframe sketches, we decided a card based layout would help us contain the shifting quantity of projects and visually tie together the diverse styles of content. This also helped us guide users to the most relevant and interesting information. I moved on to creating high-fidelity prototypes of the Restart.us website using Adobe XD to help the organization visualize the final webpage.</p>

        <p>The designs and branding guides were delivered to the web developer, who built the webpage as a Wordpress site so that Restart would be able to add and edit content as needed. We met remotely with the team to help make refinements and corrections to the styling and layouts. Since launch I have helped with updates, adding content, revising pages to follow brand guidelines, and providing ongoing technical assistance.

          <div class="project-tags">COLLABORATION</div>
          I enjoyed working collaboratively on projects with the Restart Communications team. In other design roles, Iâ€™ve worked independently or individually with a client. Working as a team was rewarding and gaining feedback from other roles helped improve our project.

          <div class="project-tags">FLEXIBILITY</div>
          The nature of being a COVID response organization meant that speed and flexibility were a higher priority than my usual work. Quick prototyping and planning for expansion were interesting challenges to tackle.

          I enjoyed being able to work on projects that helped people affected by the COVID pandemic in my own small way.
