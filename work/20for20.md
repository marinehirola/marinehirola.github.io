                  <p>In 2019 I hosted a New Year's brunch and had guests write a list of 19 things they wanted to do that year. Some people chose goals that were practical, some adventurous, and some completely silly, but ever since I've gotten feedback about how their lists sparked positive experiences. I hosted the brunch again in 2020, and a Zoom version in 2021. I was inspired to explore how the exercise could be adapted for times when we couldn't gather together and ways that the experience could be improved.

                    To better understand what made the 20 for 20 exercise work, I conducted in-person interviews with three friends who had created their own lists. My goal was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the paper version and find opportunities for improvement as I converted the experience to digital.
                    In addition to interviews, I wanted to learn more about the science behind goal setting and methodologies for achieving goals. My research led to insights that changed the framework of the project.
